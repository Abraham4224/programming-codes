In this repository, you will find code written in C#, C++, C, and JavaScript.
The exercises in C are based on the book “The C Programming Language” by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. The focus is not on writing professional C code, but on understanding C to develop better skills in other programming languages, recognizing that C is a fundamental pillar in this field.
